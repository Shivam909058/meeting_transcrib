 people who have ever left her for the destination that's cool every other action are hundreds of them are all astronauts and we still say they went into space and what that means is they went into lower worked on that's just awful i have solo record it is in practice with rubin aware of the space station is it's about a couple hundred miles up so so it so pick their distance from earth's surface to the space station is in less than they deserve from new york city to washington d. c. all called god why the press and the this sign onto shore one idea on us from that his awful thing okay so what people say the u. wanna go into space they the two summers got some little taurus think that i think him to me spaces large hill structure of the universe thank you not plainly laurin we're going to do gone before driving around the block says woolworth work it indicates that so yeah you can draw a move to earth orbit and you know for four hours off heart it's the through the road or pointing straight up so fast and so massive that and painters and implicating nasa uniquely and as when they say we're going into space that's what day in me okay now there's a functional definition of space themselves base that's to be limitless derisively called leo x. the theme of lower court next five don't actually the vent sites on mars in more power to the boat or so i kept out of space personally are so does a functional definition of space if you wanna ask have you been to space with emma have you been in orbit and that distance is the height above earth's surface we left an offer of earth's atmosphere behind you that the atmosphere is no longer scattering so i ever saw wrist gathering some more deeply into court daylight years guys door right okay that makes sense them next isolde citizens for words at an early round of the members of the waste clean over two hundred corners of or about sixty two miles to our city to do the conversion so if you get to that out to whether or not your report you go oh plough the blue sky are in the daytime blue sky and then this guy gets darker and darker impurities lack of you have more of state is so you can have earth behind you the blackness of space over one side and lillian so i'm off to the other so i will reduce the speed and you know what what is it that i had when i what do you have to do that let's get back the status of lying when it will permit this to listen to what they think had if in the flow of davilla is that the u. look to the left my single song called blue moon had no incarnate jekyll side you up for the value that i and for our bits of it so often have a problem with that except that definition that hands on earth's atmosphere doesn't that tell us suppose earth's atmosphere or were half as thick as it is for a bag on the thirty one for now i'm going after the coroners thirty one morals are you going over it in a film that suppose it was once what does that mean that you go twenty five kilometers in fifteen miles up ari now suppose it was one tent is that this ten miles of it suppose we have another strewn all go so then are you still in space just we're standing here on her because one of those two to work and in that circumstance you look up into one or have a blue sky that's why i personally a chemical that space law 'cause you're using earth's atmosphere is a definition space time i've given it so the measuring stick it cannot be the atmosphere of the body of publish a shoe not be influenced by the rappers who asked her where it i can't give it to you i'm sor i understand why you wanted to use that role because if you ever tours george did you not quite going the sort that you would believe that hollis you can see the lights going for daylight i get that but our disguise when every heart but bernie odd plane ride that swarm say well now let me just say this because i happen to go in that you know a lot of astronauts yes a lot of delighted to face no head out you're saying that the ha-ha-ha that have hopped off that to happen that without a face as late any off the heh heh heh heh heh i gotta pop that there will be life that clearly life plan that doesn't really a whole none of the horizon that hooker has worked for a royal would grow to tape and the rope hope a visit to the chest happily good day out is that his heart's blood on it i made him a sense when you come to a to save it was it was going to space take me somewhere that's all but vessel wall isn't soft some soda pop i don't want the definition of space to be contingent upon how secure atmosphere is so is so big the space station space is a step beyond that wrestled the space station is as we all have to get even at that level is stole our vendors for who'll to just one slows portals to make the day sky blue was god look so but it's too low to put anything in the sustained were you going to space station is two one to two or thirty miles that's still getting practice for portals hidden it read every now and then the space station has to be boosted back to it's original work on early prime news report calls a decaying you were so so yes this is a groan it's it's outside of fact if initial later on when i get a lower court is only outlaw where it and i'm only one will work for the poor or or or geo stickers workers though you're still have attached or if a man that i don't i'm sorry but as a natural says is to me space is large fuel structure of the universe should you know what drives them that we have been our right listen calm that i can find fault with a meeting you said it economy sense especially the destination for which i think also in spy years progress nice face anywhere you go to their destination inspires progress not let her know life is that correct pop artist or we have had her own line of let will assess what we try our the law hundred thought that what exactly the way the new that are out hard you know go anywhere not all that will allow mobile home at an who would go off would have run by the end i know nobody does that go into a destination makes all the difference of the world's only the dead yet you got aren't really call it quits the arouse another start talking players shotgun to comply with simple how do you have tipped the heightened had dropped moved how
